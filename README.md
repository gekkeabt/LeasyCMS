LeasyCMS
========

Leasy CMS is a small project of me. It is a CMS for developers who want to start making their own CMS but
they don't want to start from sketch. Also people who want to make a simple website can use it. 
Because it is simple and lightweight everybody can use it. It is smaller than 1 MB.
